Locascio<br/>Director and Undersecretary of Commerce for<br/>Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce<br/><br/>Re: December 8, 2023 Request for Information Regarding Draft Interagency Guidance Framework for Considering the Exercise of Bayh-Dole Act &ldquo;March-In Rights&rdquo; (&ldquo;Guidance Framework&rdquo;)<br/><br/>Dear Secretary Raimondo and Director Locascio:<br/><br/>On behalf of the ABA IP Section, I am submitting this comment to express our strong opposition to the proposed &ldquo;march-in&rdquo; Guidance Framework published in the Federal Register on December 8, 2023. The views expressed herein have not been reviewed or approved by the House of Delegates or the Board of Governors of the American Bar Association and, accordingly, should not be construed as representing the policy of the American Bar Association. These comments do not represent the policy or views of any government employee who is a member of the Section, its Council, or its Interest Groups.<br/>Since 1894, the American Bar Association&rsquo;s Intellectual Property Law Section (&ldquo;the ABA IP Section&rdquo;) has advanced the development and improvement of intellectual property laws, their fair and just administration, related policy issues, and, where necessary, litigation. As a major forum fostering a balanced view of legal issues and related policy initiatives concerning the U.S. economy, the ABA IP Section has earned trust of the Executive, Congressional, and Judicial Branches of our Government and the public as a respected and trusted nonpartisan substantive voice. Our membership includes private attorneys in law firms who represent small and large corporations; inventors; universities and research institutions; federal and state government agencies; academics; policy experts; and other attorney-&ldquo;thought leaders&rdquo; who are nationally recognized in this field of law.<br/><br/>&lt;&lt; please see the enclosed PDF for the rest of this comment letter &gt;&gt;<br/><br/>Fifth, no evidenced-based record has been developed to justify the issuance of the &ldquo;Guidance Framework,&rdquo; such as that required when an agency proposes to issue a regulation. In addition, the most relevant federal agencies, such as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the National Institutes of Health, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Medicine, and the Department of Education, among others were not listed as participating in the &ldquo;Interagency Working Group.&rdquo; Further, no economic or cost-benefit analysis has been undertaken, either by the Office of Management and Budget or the independent Congressional Research Service, on the effect of the proposed &ldquo;Guidance Framework&rdquo; on the U.S. economy. These omissions individually and collectively evidence agency conduct that facially is &ldquo;arbitrary and capricious.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Finally, you are well aware that our country is engaged in geopolitical competition in the fields of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, semi-conductors, broad band and digital telecommunications, telehealth, and clean and renewable energy---all of which are essential for national security. The &ldquo;Guidance Framework&rdquo; directly undermines this essential work and is contrary to the objectives of recent joint Administration and Congressional action to authorize significant new federal grants8 and establish thirty one new Tech Hubs across the country to build on the achievements of the Bayh-Dole Act.<br/><br/>For all of these reasons, the Section requests the Department of Commerce abandon the &ldquo;Guidance Framework&rdquo; in light of this comment and those of the Association of American Universities, Association of University Technology Managers, U.S. industry groups from almost every sector in the economy, including the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, United Inventors Association, and leading intellectual property academics and redirect the resources of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to its congressionally authorized and core mission &ldquo;to promote American innovation and industrial competitiveness.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Steven P. Caltrider, Chair<br/>ABA Section of Intellectual Property Law<br/><br/>",

            "comment": "I comment with regards to the issue of patent eligibility and quantum computing (Section I.3.a and II.12.a).  I attach a paper, &quot;Quantum Computing Patents/Investments Are Worthless to their Inventors/Investors&quot;.  The fundamental argument is that the transaction timing/cost, and ease of workarounds, of quantum computing is such that nationally-enforceable quantum computing patents are almost impossible to enforce in the global transnational economy, where cloud servers made it impossible to enforce patents on software running on clouds (such as quantum computing algorithms).  When quantum computing hardware becomes practical, it will be too easy to use patented quantum computing technologies outside the country where the patent was issued (most of which are in the US, the technology of which is easily moved to offshore servers, even for hardware).  Thus, to some extent, it does not matter how patent eligible a quantum computing invention may be, if when it issues, it is unenforceable.  Great inventions for end users, lousy returns for the inventors and their investors.  The USPTO should inform all patent applicants, that if they are seeking patent claims based on methods running on a server, there is a high probability that their issued patent will be unenforceable (something their lawyers rarely discuss).<br/><br/>Specific to the issue of patent eligibility and quantum computing, is the problem of the semantics of quantum physics, and one of its applications, quantum computing.  Most of the major terms of quantum physics: &#39;wavefunction&#39;, &#39;particle&#39;, &#39;system&#39;, &#39;time&#39;, &#39;set&#39; and more, have no clear definition in standard physics semantics.  The term &#39;particle&#39; alone has 7 significant potential definitions.  &#39;set&#39;, the most important term underlying physics and mathematics, has no definition other than the circular &quot;A set is a collection of ..., where a collection is a group of ..., where a group is a set of ...&quot;.  This doesn&#39;t matter much when doing calculations (&quot;The Copenhagen school of &#39;shut up and calculate&#39;&quot;), but it pretty much makes claim construction impossible during patent litigation, and allows a patent examiner to correctly issue 112 rejections because of the lack of definition of terms.  There are currently at least four schools of thought as to what is the semantics of quantum physics: the Copenhagens, the QBists, the Bohmians and the &#39;t Hooftians, each with a different definition of &#39;measurement&#39;.  So if a quantum computing patent application uses the term &#39;measurement&#39;, the examiner rightly should 112-reject until a definition is provided.  But which?  And sadly, few patent lawyers are competent in the intricate semantics of quantum physics (the USPTO needs a separate bar exam for patent lawyers who want to practice in fields such as AI and quantum computing).  Few of these patents will survive scrutiny in court during litigation, if the defendant&#39;s lawyers hire quantum physicists as experts.<br/><br/>An offer is made in the paper: for $20 million, an insurance policy can be created to insure the entire world against all existing and future quantum computing patents.  That means that all such patents, together, are worth no more than $20 million.  Since more has/will be spent on acquiring such patents, all such patents, even if all patent eligible, are worthless.  Take any quantum software method patent.  Move it to an offshore server.  Do the calculations. Send the results back to the US. Thanks to the ClearConnect decision of the CAFC, there is no infringement.<br/><br/>The attached paper offers no solutions (other than instituting a global patent, and requiring patent lawyers to be technically competent in the subject matter of the patent).  Rather, the paper uses quantum computing as a technology that clearly breaks the patent system at multiple points, as will future technologies, and reiterates the need for Constitutional analysis of the terms of 101/103/112.<br/><br/>In particular, the complex semantics of quantum computing requires, at least, that the semantics of 101/103/112 not be complex.  Yet to this date, 101/103/112, the caselaw and MPEP, completely fail Due Process Public Notice requirements of the Constitution.  Things are so bad that Justice Thomas was able to brag about NOT defining &#39;abstract&#39; in Alice.  If the patent statutes and MPEP satisfied Due Process, there would be few 101 rejections, because there would be a clear definition of &#39;abstract&#39; that lawyers could use to draft non-abstract claims, in particular, non-abstract quantum computing claims.  And to date, the USPTO has not written any memos on applying Due Process Public Notice to MPEP.<br/><br/>Impose Due Process Public Notice Requirements on statutes and MPEP, seek a global patent, and require patent lawyers to be technically competent.",

            "comment": "July 29, 2024<br/><br/>The Honorable Kathi Vidal<br/>Under Secretary and Director<br/>U.S. Patent and Trademark Office<br/>U.S. Department of Commerce<br/>Alexandria, VA 22314<br/><br/>Re:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Request for Comments Regarding the Impact of the Proliferation of Artificial Intelligence on Prior Art, the Knowledge of a Person Having Ordinary Skill in the Art, and Determinations of Patentability Made in View of the Foregoing (FRN 2024-08969)<br/><br/>Dear Under Secretary Vidal:<br/><br/>On behalf of the American Bar Association&rsquo;s Section of Intellectual Property Law, I am submitting this comment to express our views in connection with the request for comments regarding the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on, inter alia, prior art as published in the Federal Register on April 30, 2024. The views expressed herein have not been reviewed or approved by the House of Delegates or the Board of Governors of the American Bar Association and, accordingly, should not be construed as representing the policy of the American Bar Association. These comments do not represent the policy or views of any government employee who is a member of the Section, its Council, or its Interest Groups. The comments also do not represent the policy or views of any individual voting member of the Section Council or his/her employer.<br/><br/>Since 1894, the American Bar Association&rsquo;s Section of Intellectual Property Law (&ldquo;the Section&rdquo;) has advanced the development and improvement of intellectual property laws, their fair and just administration, and related policy issues. As a major forum fostering a balanced view of legal issues and related policy initiatives concerning the U.S. economy, the Section has earned trust of the Executive, Congressional, and Judicial Branches of our Government and the public as a respected and trusted nonpartisan substantive voice. Our membership includes private attorneys in law firms who represent small and large corporations; inventors; universities and research institutions; federal and state government agencies; academics; policy experts; and, other attorney-&ldquo;thought leaders&rdquo; who are nationally recognized in this field of law. <br/> <br/>I.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Introduction<br/><br/>The Section is proud of its long-time support for a strong U.S. intellectual property system, which in turn, provides pathways for innovation to enter the marketplace and its commercialization resulting in benefits for the public good. The Section applauds your efforts around seeking input on the impact of AI on the patent system, however, it has not adopted policy on each of the issues raised within the Request for Comments (&ldquo;RFC&rdquo;). This letter will provide some general comments regarding fundamental principles and answer some of the questions raised in the RFC.<br/><br/>Intellectual property and its legal protection are the catalysts for continued innovation. This is especially true in cutting-edge sectors like the life sciences, artificial intelligence, robotics, green tech, and quantum computing. Today, life sciences and modern medicine research and development and clinical trials have high start-up costs, require heavy fiscal investment, and can take decades to reach the market. Encouraging intellectual property protections and ensuring that innovators can protect and profit from their investments will create the proper incentive structures for continued U.S. global leadership in key industries, including the efficient and effective promulgation of lifesaving drugs.  Likewise, global public health would be best served by encouraging policies that provide incentives for investment and commercialization.<br/><br/>The foundation of a reliable and durable national innovation system includes predictability and certainty surrounding IP rights. Any licensing or commercialization system relies on these principles of predictability and certainty around the underlying technology and legal rights for transparency and certainty in the transaction. As our Section has articulated in prior USPTO letters and its Senate testimony, the uncertainty and unpredictability about what types of inventions qualify at the most fundamental level for patenting not only undermines the U.S. patent system, but it also creates unacceptable risks to investments that American entrepreneurs choose to pursue. . . . . <br/><br/>&lt;&lt; Please see the enclosed PDF for the entirety of our comments&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>The Section thanks the Office for the opportunity to submit these comments. We would be pleased to further discuss these comments with the Office and others as appropriate. The Section encourages the Office to continue to make strides toward patent system policies enhancing efficiency, predictability, and confidence in the U.S. patent system.  Should you have any questions or would like to discuss these issues further, please do not hesitate to contact me<br/>or the Section IP Legislative Consultant Chris Katopis at chris.katopis@americanbar.org.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Steven P. Caltrider, Chair<br/>ABA Section of Intellectual Property Law<br/><br/>",

Based on the QIS, we also<br/>developed the Knowledge Gathering Network (KGN) product that allows<br/>collaborative users to gather, create, and disseminate knowledge from<br/>diversified information sources. The Knowledge Pattern Search (KPS) product<br/>extends the KGN capability to discover knowledge patterns and apply them to<br/>search for new, interesting, and unique information. Recently we adapted KPS as<br/>a Collaborative Learning Agent (CLA) in the context of Maritime Domain Awareness<br/>(MDA). Multiple CLAs can be networked to form an agent network. The networked<br/>CLAs subsequently learn behavior patterns from the multiple data sources and can<br/>then apply them for prediction and identification of new data. CLA has been<br/>selected for a US Navy FORCEnet Sea Trial, the Trident Warrior 08.<br/><br/>We are interested in the GSA Mentor-Protege program.   We have have Phase I, II<br/>and III SBIR form DOD and DOD primes, Our technology is useful and advanced for<br/>our warfighters for future events.   <br/><br/>",

Leading Indiana&#39;s vision is the George Scalise Semiconductor Innovation Center (GSSIC).<br/><br/>The overarching goal of Indiana&rsquo;s future economic planning, research, and networking focuses on developing specific action items that the state and local governments can take to (1) equally increase resilience geographically and amongst sectors and (2) develop strategic plans that will mitigate future economic shocks, all with a careful eye toward microelectronics.<br/><br/>Indiana&rsquo;s strategic intent is to further advance as a prominent stakeholder in the U.S. Semiconductor Industry, with a specific focus on defense needs, contributing to all sectors, including research and development, design, fabrication, and packaging and test. The goal is to support the economic imperatives of the State and the national security while building a critical mass within Indiana via stakeholders and strategic partners.<br/><br/>We look forward to continuing to work closely with industry, academic and government stakeholders to move forward this essential national interest item.  <br/>",

The IRS rules on ownership of intellectual property by private sponsors of research in university facilities are unnecessarily complex and should be reformed to allow more flexibility to encourage more public/private partnerships.<br/>mproving university/corporate research partnerships is key to advancing US competitiveness. Reform of the IRS rules surrounding corporate sponsored research taking place in university facilities funded by tax-exempt bonds has long been sought by the higher education community and will stimulate more public-private partnerships. With Congress considering new ways to fund research through a new NSF Technology Directorate and the possibility of a large infrastructure package, an opportunity is now open for Congress to address these long-standing reforms in IRS rules.<br/><br/>",

            "comment": "National Priorities List (NPL) for Gelman Sciences Inc., Ann Arbor, MI<br/>The following comments are submitted on behalf of Scio Township:<br/><br/>1) Getting trigger/cleanup levels for 1,4-dioxane below 7.2 &micro;g/L: The current USEPA Drinking Water Concentration for 1,4-dioxane for a cancer risk level of 1 in 100,000 is 3.5 parts per billion (ppb), less than half of the 7.2 ppb adopted by Michigan&rsquo;s EGLE for the same risk level.  Absent an enforceable federal drinking water standard for 1,4-dioxane, many states have already adopted maximum contaminant levels or guidance standards of 1 ppb or less, conforming more closely to the EPA cancer risk level of 1 in 1,000,000 (0.35 ppb).  Given the current trajectory of regulatory action on per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are similar in many respects to 1,4-dioxane in terms of persistence and pervasiveness, we assume that USEPA Maximum Contamination Levels are likely to be established for 1,4-dioxane, as has recently been the case for many PFAS chemicals.  We urge EPA to lower the monitoring well compliance trigger level and cleanup level for the Gelman site to at least 3.5 ppb, and preferably to 0.35 ppb.<br/><br/>2) Calling for improved plume delineation: From July 2021 to August 2022, Scio Township conducted an extensive testing program for 1,4-dioxane in residential drinking water wells.  The results of the testing indicate that numerous residences located between the assumed northern boundary of the contaminant plume (as defined by Gelman) and the Huron River (located approximately one mile further north) have contaminated drinking water.  In some cases, wells located more than 4,000 feet north of the assumed plume boundary have wells contaminated with more than 1 ppb of 1,4-dioxane.  We urge USEPA to expand on the perimeter sentinel well network to the north and northeast to identify contaminant migration pathways that have evidently escaped detection.  Additional iterative testing to the north, east, and west is necessary to fully delineate the extent of the 1,4-dioxane contaminant plume. For additional information, please review Section 1 of the Scientific/Technical Justification Expert Report submitted in May 2021 by Scio Township, the City of Ann Arbor, and Washtenaw County in state court litigation. The Gelman Intervenor Expert Report is attached.<br/><br/>3) Urging adoption of EPA Method 522 for all drinking water samples and require Gelman to implement a comprehensive residential sampling program: Numerous states have adopted drinking water standards that are less than 0.5 ppb.  Of the currently available testing methods available for drinking water, only EPA Method 522 was specifically designed for analysis of 1,4-dioxane to a reporting level of less than 0.15 ppb.  Use of EPA Method 522 was essential for Scio Township in its evaluation of 1,4-dioxane in drinking water quality conducted between July 2021 and November 2022, since several residences had concentrations below 0.30 ppb.  We urge the use of USEPA Method 522 for all residential water well and public water supply analyses to provide information on exposure risks at levels consistent with the current USEPA Regional Screening Level of 0.46 ppb for potable water. Furthermore, there is no reason that local governments should bear the cost of sampling residential wells in the vicinity of the 1,4-dioxane plume. Gelman should be required to implement a comprehensive residential well sampling program which utilizes EPA Method 522.<br/><br/>On behalf of Scio Township,<br/>Will Hathaway<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Kathleen Knol<br/>Supervisor<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Trustee<br/>",

The views expressed herein have not been reviewed or approved by the House of Delegates or the Board of Governors of the American Bar Association and, accordingly, should not be construed as representing the policy of the American Bar Association. These comments do not represent the policy or views of any government employee who is a member of the Section, its Council, or its Interest Groups.<br/>Since 1894, the American Bar Association&rsquo;s Intellectual Property Law Section (&ldquo;the ABA IP Section&rdquo;) has advanced the development and improvement of intellectual property laws, their fair and just administration, related policy issues, and, where necessary, litigation. As a major forum fostering a balanced view of legal issues and related policy initiatives concerning the U.S. economy, the ABA IP Section has earned trust of the Executive, Congressional, and Judicial Branches of our Government and the public as a respected and trusted nonpartisan substantive voice. Our membership includes private attorneys in law firms who represent small and large corporations; inventors; universities and research institutions; federal and state government agencies; academics; policy experts; and other attorney-&ldquo;thought leaders&rdquo; who are nationally recognized in this field of law.<br/><br/>(see enclosed PDF for the entirety of the comments)<br/>In closing, the Section is very proud that the ABA has advocated for a strong IP system since the 1890s, and in turn, has been a part driving the U.S.&rsquo; innovation and commercialization phenomenal success story. The Section has previously cited a number of past USPTO studies that have shown that intellectual property intensive industries support at least 45 million U.S. jobs and contribute over 38% to the U.S. GDP. The above examples tell a compelling story of the impact of patent eligibility jurisprudence on jobs, the economy, and U.S. innovation. The stories feature precision medicine and diagnostics, but the impact crosses technology lines with patent claims directed to axles and cameras falling to the current defective section 101 legal jurisprudence. We invite your attention to these past Section letters and materials in response to the Federal Register Notice that share more of these useful case studies about innovation, entrepreneurship, and commercialization that would certainly be of value to you and your Administration colleagues in your task.12<br/>The Section appreciates the opportunity to offer these comments in support of the USPTO&rsquo;s review of new ways to unlock the potential of intellectual property and we commend the Office on its continued efforts. We would be happy to offer additional comments as the USPTO begins to assess the findings. Should you have any additional questions, we would welcome further discussion with the Office. Please contact either myself or Chris Katopis, IP Legislative Consultant, at chris.katopis@americanbar.org or 202-662-1779. Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>/Steven P. Caltrider/<br/>Steven P. Caltrider, Chair<br/>ABA Section of Intellectual Property Law<br/>",

I&#39;m all for safe flying but the safety tech on board DJI devices I own is a quantum leap beyond where we were just a few years ago.

The AI, ML and DL taxonomy as well as their various<br/>applications in the financial services industry is also detailed.<br/><br/>A literature survey of AI and financial services cannot ignore the econometric aspects and their implications.

PlatformBrown hereby requests an amendment to Exemption No. 15091 to allow for the use of additional UAS platforms included in the document titled &quot;Approved Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Make/Model under Section 333&quot; under the same conditions and limitations contained in Exemption No. 15091. Prior exemption numbers 15453, 12862A, 15552, are similar and all feature the same approved list of aircraft. Furthermore, PlatformBrown requests that as additional aircraft are added to the &quot;Approved Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Make/Model under Section 333&quot; document, those aircraft are automatically approved for use under Exemption No. 15091 by updating the PlatformBrown Operating Documents with the most current version of the document (See Attachment 1).<br/>PlatformBrown requests permission to operate those UAS platforms approved for use under exemption No. 15091 for the purposes of aerial data collection, surveying, photogrammetry, aerial mapping, surveillance, inspection, videography, and monitoring. In prior, similar exemptions, each and every UAS platform included in Attachment 1 has been approved by the FAA for commercial operations. Each UAV to be operated will weigh less than 55 pounds. There has been no change in the conditions and reasons relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemptions.<br/>PlatformBrown respectfully submits that this requested amendment would not be precedent setting. Additionally, numerous similar amendment requests have previously been approved. Therefore, PlatformBrown requests a determination that good cause exists to dispense with publication of the summary of this petition in the Federal Register and a grant of the requested amendment expeditiously by summary means.<br/>Thank you for your timely consideration of this petition for amendment to Exemption No. 15091<br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Jack S.

That being said, the remote ID for unmanned aircrafts should be light information. Being tracked every second of the flight, while having all systems of the drone being monitored is a violation of the users privacy. Not only that but by enforcing the people to upgrade to remote IDs and having to pay for the system is a scam of the government. A drone or unmanned aircraft will not be safe in the air using the WiFi services. Let&#39;s take a moment and actually look farther than a couple years into the future of technology. AI will become a dominating force in the people&#39;s lives meaning access and usability to internet will be faster and more proficient. This being stated rouge unmarked hackers can now find a way into the services and override drones in the sky causing a danger or threat to the people. The only way a service using internet to have very valuable information being tracked through its whole flight would have to be a quantum computing technology. This technology will prevent any information being taken or hacked. With this being stated a basic set of information could help with future navigation to autonomous drones. Such as, importance and use of flight. Elaborating On this more meaning if it&#39;s commercial use or recreational use. From there we can set a basic set of information to the drone such as user, and builder of the unmanned craft, similar to DMV set-ups .  We can do this without fees that only serve positive for government use. Until quantum computing is a solid form of tech, then all of the tracking will only benefit those whom need to know what people are doing all day, and of those who wish to spy on private flights. Please make the more informed decision, because backlash will be a huge problem. ",

As the author of the &quot;Inflammation and Heart Disease&quot; and &quot;Angina&quot; theories, my efforts to explain the interactions between certain surrogate markers and final disease has been misconstrued as briefly discussed in the first attached file. There is no relationship between changes in these markers and changes in disease, or in the initial evaluation of these diseases and surrogate blood markers. The importance is to recognize components of disease processes which may or may not be influenced to different degrees in different individuals given genetic and environmental (diet, smoking, air pollution, medications, et cetera) factors.<br/><br/>Such a lack of relationship would be expected in a sophisticated biological system designed for survival. The ability to actually measure this end organ disease is however now possible as I mentioned to &quot;Joy&quot; during our telephone conversation earlier today and as briefly discussed in the attachments. Also as discussed in these attached published papers is the importance of measuring the actual patient-specific or individual-specific disease process be that heart disease or cancer. It is now possible to measure these actual diseases themselves (both through regional blood flow differences and metabolism), unfortunately given the financial reimbursement now promised by upcoming CPT codes, there are many claiming they are now able to quantify while at the same time reporting quantified measurements, which their individual devices do not actually measure (see attachments). The misrepresentations I have brought to the attention of the FDA, which the FDA has not addressed and which I believe you will continue to fail to address, given my prior efforts to make you aware of and investigate numerous concerns including (1) coronary arteriography issues, (2) strontium-rubidium generator leaks among other problems, have only resulted in the FDA telling me there were more pressing issues which needed to be addressed. <br/><br/>All of this has only lead to more confusion in the field (FDA-2018-P-3102) and resulted in more harm and misrepresentation by these corporations. <br/><br/>That being said, I submit this rather brief discussion with documents with information relating to &quot;biomarkers&quot; for heart disease and breast cancer and again, make myself available to the FDA with the misguided hope that you will actually call upon me to provide testimony or assist in addressing these healthcare issues as they now relate to the prior submitted materials and the materials presented here on &quot;biomarkers.&quot;<br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/><br/>Dr. Fleming<br/><br/>Genetic markers (eg.

But<br/>that is not a basis for Section 101 ineligibility. All apps on<br/>all smart phones use computer implemented instructions to<br/>transform a general purpose computer (the smart phone)<br/>into a new machine. Using particular apps, one&rsquo;s smart<br/>phone can become, at turns: a compass, a flashlight, an<br/>interactive map, a &ldquo;yellow pages&rdquo;, a pedometer, a television,<br/>a videophone, etc. Each of these specific machines would<br/>of course be patentable in principle if it were hard-wired<br/>as a specific separate machine. It would be anomolous if<br/>such marvels were rendered per se ineligible for patent<br/>protection when combined in the smart phone with clever<br/>software to make them interchangeable with the push of<br/>a button.

            "comment": "Toyota Motor Engineering &amp; Manufacturing North America, Inc. (TEMA), an U.S. affiliate of Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan, hereby submits its comments with regard to the proposed rule regarding USML Category XII (22 CFR Part 121).  The proposed rule should be revised and clarifiedparticularly provisions at paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(6) and the Note to paragraph (b)(6).<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The Note to paragraph (b)(6) exempts from ITAR control certain LIDAR systems for civil automotive application.  Several other paragraphs of the proposed rule, however, would appear to negate the usefulness of this exemption by placing many of the critical components of LIDAR systems under ITAR control.  Because an item containing an ITAR-controlled component is thereby subject to ITAR control itself, this exemption would be limited to only those systems that contain no component listed in Category XII.  Because Category XII would control many components that are critical in an effective automotive LIDAR system (especially the IRFPAs discussed below), it would be difficultif not impossibleto construct a LIDAR system effective for automotive safety application that contains no ITAR-controlled component. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The Note to (b)(6) is also unnecessarily restrictive with regard to the range of the LIDAR systems for civil automotive applications.  For automotive safety purposes, enhancing the range of the LIDAR means providing the driver with greater potential response time.  TEMA understands that LIDAR systems for automotive application with ranges in excess of 200 meters are already under development.  We suggest revising this restriction to 400 meters.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In order of preference, TEMA respectfully suggests either of the following alternatives to the Note to (b)(6):<br/>Alternative 1:  Exclude from ITAR control LIDAR components designed for civil automotive LIDAR systems:<br/>Note to paragraph (b)(6): This paragraph Category XII does not control LIDAR Systems, components or parts of such Systems, or equipment for civil automotive applications.<br/>Alternative 2:  Exclude from ITAR control LIDAR components designed for civil automotive LIDAR systems having a range limited to 400 meters or less.<br/>Note to paragraph (b)(6): This paragraph Category XII does not control LIDAR Systems, components or parts of such Systems, or equipment for civil automotive applications having a range limited to 200 400 m or less.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>TEMA also requests revision of Paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(6).  These paragraphs would effectively preclude the incorporation of an Infrared Focal Plane Array (IRFPA) into an automotive LIDAR system.  For civil collision avoidance, a LIDAR system must be able to detect and track distant objects in real time. To do so, a LIDAR needs high spatial resolution and wide coverage in a short time period (fast update rate) while the vehicle is in motion.  An IRFPA is uniquely capable of achieving this performance by using time-of-flight (TOF) to instantaneously create a 3D depth map. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Together, paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(6) would control IRFPAs with a wavelength between 900 nm and 30,000 nm.  This limitation would preclude the use of IRFPAs for automotive application since, as noted below, all wavelengths potentially useful for automotive application fall within that range:<br/>1400-1600 nm<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Detection of automobiles and other objects<br/>30005000 nm<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Penetration of mist, dust, smoke and other small particles<br/>1000015000 nm<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Detection of persons and live animals<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Wavelengths below 1400 nm are not eye-safe and those above 15,000 nm are insufficiently intense for any automotive safety application.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Additionally, paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(6) should be revised since the IRFPAs that would be controlled thereunder are already available internationally, including the following: (i) Chunghwa Leading Photonics Tech. (Taiwan) InGaAs FPA 320 x 256 (Exhibit 1); and (ii) Xenics (Belgium) InGaAs XFPA-1.7-640-LN2 (Exhibit 2). <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In order of preference, TEMA respectfully suggests either of the following alternatives with regard to paragraph (c)(2):   <br/>Alternative 1: Revise Note 1 to paragraph (c)(2) to include the following:<br/>IRFPAs used in automotive LIDAR systems are not subject to the ITAR.<br/>Alternative 2: Revise (c)(2) to control only those IRFPAs specially designed for military application, as follows:<br/>(c)(2) Photon detector, microbolometer detector, or multispectral detector infrared focal plane arrays (IRFPAs) specially designed for military application , , ,.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Finally, TEMA requests revision of paragraph (c)(12)(viii), which would control certain photon detector IRFPAs with a resolution exceeding 111,000 detector elements.  This standard is already outdated, as the standard video graphics array (VGA) is currently 307,200 pixels.  TEMA does not yet know the optimal resolution of an IRFPA in a production automotive LIDAR system, but to avoid hindering automotive safety research, we believe the restriction should be set no lower than 327,680 (640 x 512) detector elements.<br/>",

As I explain in the attached document, the proposed Framework would twist Bayh-Dole and weaken the U.S. intellectual property system is misguided and will harm market competition, consumer access to new technologies, and our strategic global interests in technology leadership.

            "comment": "The US economy is driven by the rich and diverse technologies and ideas that arise from many small endeavors. From garage based startups to university research projects, the US innovation culture excels in nurturing talented people with new visions of how things should be done. Cellular technology by contrast is developed by a few powerful players (as evidenced by the distribution of 3GPP submissions and related patents) who can afford the R&amp;D costs and the price of spectrum. Spectral policy in the US and elsewhere has already made progress on relaxing spectrum rules, allowing a more diverse set of players to participate. 6G technology must lean into this direction, not just in spectral policy, but also in equipment and system development. 6G must become a catalyst for a more diverse and creative ecosystem of developers of new solutions and must also enable and support the users of those solutions, especially in the US. <br/><br/>This is especially critical for small businesses, many of whom don&rsquo;t have an IT department, but who need to remain competitive in the face of competition from other, perhaps larger, players. Today 5G remains too expensive and complex to install and maintain. 6G must be easy to adapt so it can be used in creative ways by a diversity of businesses for a diversity of use cases. <br/><br/>The Open RAN movement has made impressive progress towards providing traditional operators with stronger control over how their networks are deployed but has not yet addressed the problems outlined above regarding agility and flexibility of system development and deployment involving large and small technology contributors, and solutions customized/optimized for a diversity of use cases. Addressing these issues is key to 6G success.<br/><br/>6G must enable use case discovery in new markets, by the players in these markets, not cellular communications experts, so that it can spread rapidly and provide value throughout the economy. This can only happen if the value and use of 6G can be discerned by player in each potential market through dialog at a relevant depth and detail, and systems and be rapidly developed to address these markets with the required performance/price point. The ability to rapidly deploy new solutions to new markets, without the involvement of big OEMs or standardization will be essential to enable 6G success beyond the consumer market fueled by smartphones and similar consumer devices.<br/><br/>Our startup, Cirrus360 Corp., has developed a RAN Domain Specific Language (RDSL) driven automation framework (platform name: GABRIEL) for development, testing, deployment, and upgrades of RAN components, starting with the Distributed Unit (DU). In Mobile World Congress 2024, Barcelona, our RDSL driven Intelligent RAN Automation, was recognized with a Global Mobile (GLOMO) award in the category &ldquo;Best Digital Tech Breakthrough for companies under $10 million Annual Global Revenue&rdquo;. We are currently engaged with open RAN industry leaders with whom we have jointly proven the significant efficiencies to be gained from our platform. For macrocellular deployments, GABRIEL enables hardware/software system level composition, optimizing total cost of ownership (TCO). For Private 5G, GABRIEL enables use case optimized connectivity, addition of new QoS and security guarantees to 5G systems, extending open RAN and 5G standards from consumer to customized enterprise use, to making 5G work for security sensitive DoD applications and use cases.<br/>",

            "comment": "Proposed Guidance Will Eviscerate the 40-year, $54 BB Federal SBIR Program<br/><br/>We are a Small Business performing R&amp;D primarily for the Defense Department for more than 30 years. We typically earn a small profit when our R&amp;D expenses are treated using section 162. Under prior Law and IRS policy, for every $100 of R&amp;D contract award, for example, roughly 90% are actual R&amp;D expenses, generating $10 of real income and cash and about $3 in Tax (at a 30% rate).<br/><br/>Under the proposed Guidance, our contract R&amp;D Business Model no longer makes any financial sense. Limiting deductible expenses to only 10% of those $90 (i.e., $9) in the first year means our taxable income on the same $100 contract is now $91 (9 times higher!). At a 30% tax rate, the tax due is about $27, almost three times the $10 actual income and cash generated from the contract. We now need to use $17 of our capital to pay our taxes. For a firm primarily performing contract R&amp;D, this is clearly unsustainable.  <br/><br/>Much larger firms like Raytheon, Northrop Grumman and others generate profits from other sources and can pay the additional tax due under the Guidance, as has been noted in the Wall Street Journal. Smaller, less mature firms like those with SBIR/STTR  awards typically don&rsquo;t have the profit streams or cash reserves to pay greatly increased tax year after year.<br/><br/>This has multiple negative impacts for the United States: <br/>&bull; Many small R&amp;D businesses will be forced into bankruptcy or will shut down. Attached please find 26 case histories of SBIR awardees describing the <br/>  devastating impact this proposed Guidance will have. Our firm, which has been very active in the SBIR program for decades, has decided it simply can no <br/>  longer participate. <br/><br/>&bull; The SBIR/STTR program will effectively be crippled, as the Guidance is a strong DISincentive for small business participation. This federal program has <br/>  existed for 40 years and has funded $54 BB under almost 180,000 R&amp;D contracts.  It has been repeatedly reauthorized by Congress by overwhelming <br/>  majorities (most recently by 415-9 in 2022). This Guidance will effectively gut this program. <br/><br/>&bull; The largest Government beneficiary of the SBIR/STTR program is the Defense Department, which currently funds $1.8 BB through SBIR/STTR annually, <br/>  awarding 2,400 R&amp;D contracts to enhance US military superiority. Most of these firms will no longer Bid on DOD SBIR/STTR work under the proposed <br/>  Guidance. <br/><br/>&bull; Well-capitalized small businesses (a very small minority) may continue to participate in SBIR because they can benefit from what will now essentially <br/>  become a cost-share contract. Rather than shoulder 100% of the cost of their own R&amp;D projects, those with large cash reserves can seek Government SBIR <br/>  funding for 73% of their costs and then only bear 27% of the cost in Tax payments (using the example above). <br/><br/>&bull; Now, in addition to a capital advantage, very well-capitalized small businesses will also benefit from the Preferred IP Rights in the SBIR program. This <br/>  benefit is codified in DFARS 252.227-7018 and was expressly created  to &ldquo;level the playing field&rdquo; for SBIR awardees to encourage commercialization. <br/>  Preferred IP rights allow SBIR recipients to better compete for downstream non-SBIR Government work. Under the Guidance, most (thinly capitalized) small <br/>  businesses will be further disadvantaged vs. well-capitalized small businesses that secure SBIR awards, completely contrary to Congressional and <br/>  Government intent. <br/><br/>&bull; This defeats the express Congressional intent of the SBIR program, reaffirmed every 5 years  over the past 40 years.  SBIR was always intended as an <br/>  INCENTIVE for Small Business to perform Government R&amp;D for two reasons:<br/><br/>    o Small businesses are ten times more effective converting R&amp;D funding into new permanent jobs (the ultimate objective of the SBIR program), and <br/>    o Much of the innovation that spurs early R&amp;D originates from small firms and startups, rather than much larger, more mature and bureaucratic companies.<br/><br/>&bull; Under 162 R&amp;D expensing, the Government benefited from a highly competitive SBIR award process, with the ratio of Proposers to Awardees about 10:1, <br/>  resulting in very high-quality R&amp;D awards. With most small businesses unable to afford participation, and only a few well-capitalized firms bidding, this ratio <br/>  will likely drop drastically. The quality of the work performed for the Government under SBIR/STTR (at taxpayer expense) is likely to suffer from greatly <br/>  decreased competition. <br/><br/>Tax policy affects all elements of commerce, including performance of R&amp;D. As commerce increasingly embraces technology, R&amp;D breakthroughs are increasingly the basis for corporate and national competitiveness and even entirely new fields of commerce such as AI. Therefore, we urge the IRS to consider the highly negative (and unintended) effects of the proposed Guidance on other Congressional and federal objectives such as the SBIR/STTR program.<br/>",

            "comment": "I have a very important personal concern. I am severely, now almost debilitatingly, affected by wireless devices, including those found in vehicles. There are thousands of people like myself. 1. In what way will this technology be modified so that people like myself can drive and use public transportation? 2. If this technology cannot be modified, then how are people like myself supposed to function in society? We cannot live like hermitswe have to get groceries, go to the doctor, etc. Regardless of what kind of vehicle we drive, we will be affected by the radiofrequency, as it travels through the air. 3. What will you do to ensure that the health effects of this new technology be investigated prior to its widespread deployment? This means impartial investigations and studiesincluding epidemiological and cell and tissue studies. Kindly make a direct and thoughtful response to these questions, as well as the material related following these questions. Two years ago, I had no problems with cell phones or with Wi-Fi in buildings. Then, smart electric meters were installed in my city (but not on my home). Since that time I have become increasingly affected by all sorts of electrical devices, from cell phones to televisions to LED lights. Theodore Litovitz of the Catholic University patented a method to demodulate the harmful signal by adding a low frequency electromagnetic noise to the signal. This method should be further investigated and it or something like it added to the signal if it is incorporated in vehicles. Concerns About Wireless in Cars. Beginning about three weeks ago, I began to experience strange sensations going through my head, heart, and lungs when in proximity to certain vehicles. I fear I will suddenly have a loss of consciousness (however brief), that will cause me to lose control of my vehicle. About six months, ago, two young men I know, both from the same family, actually lost consciousness briefly while driving in Ann Arbor. Both are EMF sensitive. (One has had severe changes in his blood sugar levels due to a smart meter on his home [his blood sugar levels returned to normal after his mother removed the meter]. The mother is also severely EMF sensitive.) I and these two young men are not the only people to experience this, but they are two stories I will relate. Certain brands of vehicles cause me more problems than others. Even if the car drives itself, I will be unable to ride in it because of the wireless. Even if I am able to keep my own vehicle, the increased amount of wireless on the roadway will likely make driving impossible for me and many others. I cannot even fly on an airplane or take a bus or train due to the wireless. This means I cannot visit my aging parents, who live 2000 miles away from me. If you had asked me two years ago whether this technology would be a problem for me, I would have told you no. That is not the case today. Scientific DataIn Case You Have Doubts. One of the reasons that wireless technologies cause a host of seemingly odd and unrelated symptoms is that the waves knock calcium ions off the cell membrane. Calcium is plays a crucial role in neurotransmission (brain communication, heart rhythm, blood pressure, oxygen intake, etc.). See the articles in the footnote. Why some people are extremely affected by electromagnetic waves is not known, but there are literally thousands of studies showing that cells are affected by themusually in a deleterious way. Only a few epidemiological studies have been conducted. All of them indicate that peopleeven those who feel no changes in their healthare adversely, often severely, affected. There is mounting evidence that most people will be affected over the long term. If you studied a group of smokers for a day or three months, or even a year, you would likely find no changes in their health status. This is not an indication that tobacco is not harmful, as we now know, 40 years later. So it is with the wireless frequencies so commonly used today. Why You, As a Public Official, Should Be Concerned. As you can see from my story, someone can start off with few or no problems with electromagnetic frequencies. Saturation of our environment leads to increased sensitivity. One cigarette twenty feet away from you might not be a problem. Unlike with cigarettes, most people arent even aware of the presence of these electromagnetic frequencies (they cant smell or see them), so do not know they are being affected or do not know why they are suddenly having health problems. Electromagnetic frequencies cause breaks in the structure of DNA. Over time, this leads to cancer. It will take one two decades to see the effects of the pervasive, 24/7 use of these technologies. Childrens brains are the most sensitive, and it is in our children and grandchildren that we will see the worst of the adverse affects of these seemingly time-saving technologies.

Orji and Ramaswamy,<br/><br/>MITRE Engenuity is submitting this response in support of the above referenced Request for Information from the Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), regarding &ldquo;Incentives, Infrastructure, and Research and Development Needs to Support a Strong Domestic Semiconductor Industry.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Our vision for the NSTC and NAPMP is to create a new paradigm for innovation that will impact U.S. technological leadership for decades to come. The creation of the NSTC and NAPMP is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to secure U.S. leadership in semiconductors. The NSTC and NAPMP will have to be structured to accommodate the complex priorities and collective vision of the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem. Closing the gap between R&amp;D and commercialization will accelerate innovation and enhance supply chain resilience for economic and national security. <br/><br/>MITRE Engenuity has a heritage of neutrality, commitment to the public good, strategic vision, and commitment to the mission of solving problems for a safer world. MITRE Engenuity has founded The Semiconductor Alliance, a collaborative effort with leading organizations from the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem and academia to begin to design the framework for the NSTC and NAPMP. For the NSTC and NAPMP to be successful, they must unite world-leading research and development in our universities, national laboratories, our industry-leading corporations, and the ingenuity of our entrepreneurs.<br/><br/>If you have any questions regarding our submission, please contact Dr. Raj Jammy, CTO (rjammy@mitre-engenuity.org). MITRE Engenuity looks forward to further opportunities to assist the government in achieving its goals.<br/><br/>Warm regards,<br/>Dr. Laurie Giandomenico, CEO<br/>Email: lg@mitre-engenuity.org<br/><br/>Encl.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>SEMI Survey Highlights Member Recommendations for U.S. Chip Industry Competitiveness, Government Investment (pdf document).<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>American Innovation, American Growth: A Vision For The National Semiconductor Technology Center (pdf document).",

Confirmed by FCC there is no proof that it is safe !!!<br/>How can this be that our regulatory agencies are captured by the telecommunications industry, are not working on behalf of public safety but rather on behalf of corporate profits.  Society cannot survive wilth this paradigm any longer.  All environmental infrastructures are collapsing.  We are in the midst of an insect apocalypse, massive bird extinctions, bat populations an near extinction levels and half the population has some kind of chronic disease.  Meanwhile we need a death penalty for corporate hacks like Adjit Pai and other industry assassins that continue to market wireless technology when they know how dangerous it is.  Science continues to be either ignored or suppressed as our government agencies continue their complicity in killing people, insects and animals.  Even tree die offs from placement of cell towers has been confirmed.  The Dept. of the interior wrote a letter ( http://1.usa.gov/1jn3CZg ) to the FCC  complaining of the effects of cell towers on bird populations.  Corrpution between government and industry is completely transparent, no longer even hidden behind a veil of half truths.  Everybody knows that our regulatory agencies are corrupt and on the take.<br/>Apply NEPA to the 5G roll out.  The climate debacle cannot take the amount of energy necessary to power a cell antenna every 100 feet.<br/>David Morrison / ",

            "comment": "Attn: Divisions of Dockets Management.<br/><br/>The FDA has failed in it&#39;s responsibility to protect USA citizens. This comment includes FOUR very specific items of concern.<br/><br/>FIRST, by failing to require the pharmaceutical companies which have produced Sestamibi and Tetrofosmin to note that their radioactive isotopes &quot;redistribute&quot; and only require a single dose of isotope instead of two, the FDA has failed in its responsibility to protect the public from unnecessary exposure to radiation and it has allowed these companies to bill for multiple doses of isotope instead of a single dose. This has increased the costs of studies both for patients and insurance companies including CMS payments. These pharmaceutical companies are aware of this redistribution property and have been aware of it for almost two decades. This reporter has published multiple papers in peer reviewed medical journals, presented at multiple medical conferences and has in fact corresponded with these companies who admit to the redistribution. The FDA has allowed this practice through it&#39;s review of the companies literature and has failed to correct this despite being notified of this previously.<br/><br/>SECOND, the Federal Government, through CMS has established CPT billing codes for payment of &quot;quantification&quot; of nuclear imaging, most specifically PET imaging. PET imaging methods reported as &quot;quantitative&quot; are NOT quantitative. As established in the medical literature, there is only one actual method for quantification and the FDA has not acted upon the claims made by the nuclear camera companies that their systems quantify. In fact, the companies are misrepresenting what they call &quot;quantification&quot; and this too has been established in the peer reviewed medical literature by the reporter.<br/><br/>THIRD, Nuclear TRUE quantification requires the calibration of nuclear cameras to a known standard. This is true for every other field of science. This is a requirement to guarantee that all tools used to measure scintillations are actually able to measure scintillations. There has been only one patented method for this calibration of nuclear cameras. This patented method (FMTVDM) provides for &quot;Quantitative Control&quot; in contrast to &quot;Qualitative Control&quot; and it is this &quot;Quantitative Control&quot; which is required to guarantee that nuclear cameras are actually measuring what they are reporting they are measuring. The reporter has published in the peer reviewed medical literature and presented at medical conferences proof that specific settings currently used in nuclear cameras (both SPECT and PET) result in a 33.95 error rate, making any further efforts to &quot;quantify&quot; outcomes completely meaningless and misrepresentative of the science.<br/><br/>FOURTH, Approval of &quot;micro-dose&quot; mammography under the pretense that it exposes the woman or man to less radiation than a conventional mammogram. While dense breasts exist in half of the population, requiring state legislation to address the failure of the FDA to issue warnings about the limitations of mammography, even after the NCI and Canadian Trial have demonstrated there is no &quot;survival benefit&quot; associated with mammography, the FDA has failed to address this failure of mammography. Adding to the problem is the approval for micro-dose (3D-tomosynthesis) with the claim that it reduces a woman or mans radiation exposure. In truth, if the FDA were to read the patent, the amount of radiation &quot;per slice&quot; is less, but the same is true for any test if one only looks at part of something-it is less than the whole. The actual radiation delivered is greater using this &quot;micro-dose&quot; approach without any demonstrable benefit to the U.S. population. In fact, there are typically between 7-11 slices per breast image and when added together, which is what one needs to do to determine the total impact, the actual dose is greater. A fact which should be obvious considering that conventional mammography uses 24-32 kVp while tomosynthesis uses 25-50 kVp.<br/><br/>The FDA has failed to protect the public by (1) not correcting the misinformation about isotope redistribution and the need for only a single dose of isotope, increasing costs, inaccuracy and patient radiation (2) not requiring nuclear camera companies to only claim &quot;quantification&quot; when they are truly &quot;quantifying&quot; which requires &quot;quantitative calibration&quot;, (3) not requiring nuclear cameras undergo &quot;nuclear quantification calibration&quot; using the patented method approved by the USPTO and (4) allowing the use of &quot;micro-dose&quot; 3D-tomosynthesis which increases radiation exposure without benefit, while being allowed to claim it reduces radiation exposure.<br/><br/>More material is available upon request.<br/><br/>I encourage the pharmaceutical, mammography and nuclear camera companies to be transparent, honest and to demonstrate the integrity commensurate with their responsibilities to the people they are selling their tests and radioactive isotopes to.<br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/><br/>Dr. Fleming",

But now that the employee-employer relation has come into picture, these companies are not able to find people to join them. So,if this rule is implemented, most H4 EADs will join such companies and we will see more advertisements like this.<br/><br/>&quot;Wanted H4 EAD candidates for C# or .NET programming. Free training after a long break in your career, free guest house to live till you get the project, guaranteed placement(because someone in the ad-posting company itself will answer interview call)&quot;<br/><br/>This is going to be the future of these H4 EAD approval. Please do not pass this rule as it will negate the value of legal immigrants like us who have done masters and got H1bs with established consulting companies like Deloitte, Infosys, TCS, Wipro or even consulting companies established in the 90s that have been following employer-employee relation. <br/><br/>Please check the PDF for more details.<br/><br/>Thanks!",

In fact, contrary to what they state, they don&rsquo;t like freedom in general and flying is one of the most prominent symbols of freedom we have.  They are taking our freedoms away slowly and surely; just like boiling a frog.  And 9/11 was an excellent opportunity for them to take a quantum leap in this direction.  I sit here in Los Angeles writing this as TFRs are to take effect in an hour or so.  I am a consultant who flies into Van Nuys nearly every day from way out in the desert to work on high tech stuff including a cure for the blind.  I realize that some precautions need to be taken when the president travels, but 30 nautical miles?  What has Mr. Bush got to do that is more important than what I and everyone else around here who flies has to do?  Mr. Bush, I voted for you, but if you are afraid of little airplanes please stay home and video-conference.  I really feel sorry for those who live around Washington who will have to put up with this permanently.  This is not in the American spirit. Another person who wrote in likened the D.C.

            "comment": "I found it extremely odd for this regulation to be put in. This is an act to kill and restrict H1-B visa programs for high skilled foreign workers. It is going to harm the United States and its people in various ways and here are a few reasons for my argument:<br/><br/>1. This sends a clear message that the United States does not welcome foreign workers, which discourage talents around the world to congregate in the Land of the Free. The reason that the United States has been No.1 in the world in technological advancement and leader in science and economy is thanks to countless skilled and talented foreign workers who came to the US and built their lives here. Many examples including scientists who were involved in the Manhattan Project. Albert Einstein, Sergey Brin, Elon Musk, leoh Ming Pei, etc. were famous foreign talents that made this country great. I once heard as long as the US is still attracting all the talents around the world, it will keep standing on the mountain top. Sadly, this is no longer true with the current administration who blame US job loss to foreign workers who actually fill jobs that couldn&#39;t be filled by Americans. If this goes for long, the US will lose the race of collecting talents to other Western countries like Canada, UK, Australia, and developing economy like India and China. <br/><br/>2. Making the prevailing wages high certainly can discourage Tech giants and multiple industry from hiring foreign workers. The problem is whether the US labor market can supply those industries with skilled domestic employees. Based on the current statistics, international students made up a large portions of college, master, and PhD students in the field of STEM. They were admitted to the program not only because the schools and programs wanted their money, but also because the programs deem them qualified to be studying in those fields. The majority of these students plan or planned to start a career in the US. We are talking about students who will be experts in Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, Biomedical Engineering, Quantum physics, Advanced Chemical synthesis, and even complex trade model design. Making those students&#39; life hard is first harmful for US economy, and second making it easier for them to bring their talent elsewhere. <br/><br/>3. Foreign employees work harder and have high loyalty to their employers due to Visa sponsorship. US citizens and permanent residents have wider options due to the lack of risk of deportation. So they explore their options more and collect more wages and have higher tendency to be uncooperative towards companies&#39; decisions. Foreign employees receive lower wages and work their butt off to create more values for the company. This exploitation has been crucial for tech companies&#39; success. Tech industry is the future and will be the backbone of this nation as the history progress. Harming their interests might seem fun and empowering now, but as the time goes on, the US will lose the race to tech giants from other countries. Even worse, US tech companies may start moving elsewhere that has more flexible work and immigration policy for their work force to be at the best shape. <br/><br/>I whole hearted oppose this regulation and I think it will do more harm than good for the US economy and global dominance.",

This is nothing but going back to 2008 and in fact, giving more privilege of not even having to prove education requirements or valid job offer from US based organizations (not consulting) by granting EAD directly to all spouses who may not even have a skilled labor. It is h4 to h1 again...Why did USCIS even spend that time and energy to deport fraudulant employer/employees, stamping issues by giving 221g slips for admin processing, h4 to h1 RFEs, employer-employee relation introduction etc, if at the end of the day, they would grant EAD to entertain body shopping and &quot;wanted&quot; ads where no americans need apply. It is not applying for the jobs existing as per LCA rules, it is creating jobs for these EAD holders. PLEASE DO NOT PASS THIS RULE.",

            "comment": "We write today to express our support for the Clean Power Plan and encourage the Environmental Protection Agency to keep the rule in place. The CPP provides the certainty businesses need to continue investing in clean energy, and it is essential to United States&#39; commitment under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Most importantly, as China continues to invest in non-carbon energy sources, American must not fall behind.<br/><br/>Any discussion about regulation should consider the economic impact that it will have on companies of all sizes. This means measuring the cost of the regulation itself but also the costs of the problem the regulation is intended to fix. As we consider the future of the Clean Power Plan, it is important to understand that the minimal potential increase in electricity rates pales in comparison to the costs we experience because of severe weather and climate change.<br/><br/>We represent a wide range of business sizes, types, and sectors, but we are all increasingly vulnerable to climate change. The restaurant owners among us face increasing food prices. The manufacturers among us experience more downtime because parts or materials don&#39;t make it to the factory in time. IT companies worry about power loss, and real estate developers and insurance companies caution that more frequent natural disasters make property far more vulnerable. Retailers warn about severe weather&#39;s impact on foot traffic.<br/><br/>Almost every business has lost time and money because of travel delays.<br/><br/>As fellow business leaders, we encourage the Trump Administration to maintain the CPP. It will help ensure the United States plays a leading role in developing the new energy technology that will power the world and will help curb climate change by reducing our carbon output.<br/><br/>See attached file for signatories",

            "comment": "I am a professor at Stanford who has trained many foreign PhD&#39;s who have gone on to contribute to the American economy at major tech companies.  This proposed policy is extremely misguided. Many technical PhD&#39;s in the US can take 6 years or more.  My own PhD in theoretical physics took me 6 years. Some extremely difficult PhD&#39;s can take 8.  For example, a recent PhD from Berkeley made a major advance in quantum computing, which is a major national initiative, by concentrating on a single problem for 8 years.  It is difficult to know ahead of time how long any given PhD will take. Part of the reason America has been successful is that we have been able to attract the best and brightest to our shores to complete PhD&#39;s and we have been able to retain them to work in the US.  This ability has given us an immense technology advance and boosted our GDP significantly according to many well known economic analyses.  As a professor at Stanford, who trains many PhD students, I can attest to the fact that we simply will not be able to attract foreign nationals if we put a hard limit on their stay.  We will cede our incredible talent advantage to other nations, rendering the US extremely uncompetitive economically and technologically.  Please stop this insane attempt to undercut American competitiveness, in the face of what appears on the surface to be blatant xenophobia.  ",

            "comment": "Re: USPTO Patent Eligibility Jurisprudence Study (PTO-P-2021-0032-0002)<br/><br/>Dear Acting Director Hirshfeld:<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The American Bar Association Section of Intellectual Property Law (&ldquo;Section&rdquo;) thanks the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&ldquo;USPTO&rdquo;) for the opportunity to provide comments in response to the USPTO patent eligibility jurisprudence study set forth in the Federal Register Notice on July 9, 2021 (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;). The views expressed herein are presented on behalf of the Section of Intellectual Property Law. They have not been reviewed or approved by the House of Delegates or the Board of Governors of the American Bar Association and, accordingly, should not be construed as representing the position of the Association. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Since 1894, the Section has advanced the development and improvement of intellectual property laws and their fair and just administration. As the forum for rich perspectives and balanced insight on the full spectrum of intellectual property law, the Section serves within the ABA as a highly respected voice in the intellectual property profession, before policy makers, and with the public. Section members include attorneys who represent patent owners and applicants, accused infringers, small to large corporations, universities, and research institutions across a wide range of industries. Our members are attorneys in private practice, in-house counsel, public sector attorneys, and others.<br/><br/>I.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Observations and Experiences<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We commend the USPTO for its initiative in undertaking the further study of these issues of fundamental importance not only to the patent bar but for the public in general. The interpretation of section 101 of the patent statute (35 U.S.C. &sect; 101) defines the types of inventions and discoveries that are eligible for patent protection and thereby the contours of our innovation ecosystem.<br/><br/>    The Section appreciates the USPTO&rsquo;s continued efforts to implement examination guidance in light of the challenges posed by the current state of U.S. legal jurisprudence. We also commend the efforts of the USPTO over the past decade to improve patent quality, especially in technologies that have been the subject of patent eligibility questions in the USPTO as well as in the courts. We encourage the USPTO to continue those efforts in order to strengthen the validity of issued patents and reduce the uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to patent eligibility requirements. Today, patent subject matter eligibility is ever more uncertain, ambiguous, and unpredictable, as evidenced by recent federal court opinions that have effectively left the system &ldquo;broken&rdquo; in the eyes of many. <br/><br/>    The Section has provided comments to governmental inquiries following the decisions of the Supreme Court in Bilski, Mayo, Myriad, and Alice, as well as subsequent applications of that precedent by the Federal Circuit.   Of note is that we believe the summary of the status of the case law in the Supplementary Information of the Notice is a fair statement of the current law including the recent expansion of patent eligibility jurisprudence by the Federal Circuit into a broad range of technologies (e.g., mechanical drive shafts).<br/><br/>    Our Section has voiced particular concern about the effect the current status of eligibility law has had and will likely continue to have in at least three primary areas:<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Negative effects on small businesses, midsize ones, and individual innovators, to whom patent protection of new technology is critical to their success and ability to secure investment;  <br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Loss of global competitiveness as certain technologies are recognized as patent eligible in major competitor countries like China, but not in the U.S., which over time risks moving R&amp;D overseas where these technologies may be more easily protected than in the U.S.;  and,<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Diminishment of licensing activity and loss of a U.S.-centric international licensing regime particularly with respect to SEPs and other technologies tied to large international portfolios.  <br/><br/>The entirety of our comments are enclosed in the corresponding PDF. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>As USPTO studies have shown, intellectual property intensive industries support at least 45 million U.S. jobs and contribute over 38% to the U.S. GDP.  The above examples tell a compelling story of the impact of patent eligibility jurisprudence on jobs, the economy, and U.S. innovation. The stories feature precision medicine and diagnostics, but the impact crosses technology lines with patent claims directed to axles and cameras falling to section 101.  Appendix A maps these stories to the specific questions in the Notice. If further opportunities arise in connection with the Notice or subsequent notices, the Section would be pleased to supplement its response. Should you have any questions or would like to discuss these issues further, please do not hesitate to contact me.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Kim R. Jessum, Chair<br/>ABA Section of Intellectual Property Law<br/><br/>",

In my scientific opinion, this really has to be stated specifically on a species level. For example, the harvested alga Ascophyllum nodosum survived the last glacial maximum in North America (Olsen, J. L. &amp; Stam, W. T. 2000. Separating population structure from population history in Ascophyllum nodosum (Fucales). J. Phycol. 36S:523). and is very abundant across the North Atlantic.  It has been harvested sustainably in many areas of the North Atlantic for centuries, and how to manage for sustainable harvest is known (see DMR Fisheries Management Plan for Ascophyllum, attached). In contrast, climate change is causing overheating events in coastal waters that are having a negative impact on many kelp species in many parts of the world (but not everywhere); thus, harvest management to be sustainable must take into account whether kelp resilience is changing. In Morocco, wild harvest of the small red alga Gelidium (an agar producer) was too intensive in recent years, and the government has restricted harvest, according to what Ive read in Nature press reports.<br/><br/>2.   Could practice standards or guidelines be created ....<br/>Unlikely. Reproduction, life spans etc. are too different across the macrophytic marine algae that are harvested.  For example some kelps are annuals while others are perennial.  Some algae that are harvested lose biomass annually due to natural causes (e.g., breakage of Ascophyllum nodosum in storms and from ice shear in estuaries in winter, for example, Vadas, R. L., W. A. Wright, and B. F. Beal. 2004. Biomass and productivity of intertidal rockweeds in Cobscook Bay. Northeastern Naturalist 11(special issue 2):123-142), but regenerate (FMP, 2014) from short shoots or holdfasts (see FMP, 2014). <br/><br/>3. What are the environmental implications of taking no action?  It could be serious or inconsequential.  See my answer to Q1.<br/>4. Define an efficient, science-based method for measuring existing biomass to establish a baseline. How would this be measured post-harvest? Is there existing data from established harvest regions? <br/>There are transect/random sampling designs for doing so (e.g., the FMP), but I expect drones and GIS maps will increasingly be used, especially for intertidal species.<br/>5. For all algae, what are the best methods for harvesting that minimize the impact on the recovery of the population of the harvested species and maintain ecosystem function and services? What would be measured and what benchmarks would be set? Who should determine the methods/benchmarks? <br/>I again think this is a species-specific matter, and one a state or national governmental regulatory body is best able to make.<br/>6.Are there some species that are so important to ecosystem structure and function that harvest should not be permitted at all? <br/>Not, I think, in the case of marine algaebut management will be very different among species, and harvesting should be managed to avoid loss of ecosystem structure and function. <br/>7. Should there be protected areas that are off limits to harvesting? Should seasonal restrictions be considered? <br/>Definitely, yes. Marine Protected Areas are important as baselines to measure natural change that might otherwise be thought to be due to harvesting practices, and for sustainable ecosystem function, including as a source of propagules to maintain genetic diversity and recruitment of species being fished/harvested adjacent to the no-harvest areas.<br/>8. What is an acceptable level of bycatch? Should this be assessed on a species by species basis? Are there any bycatch species that could prevent harvesting in an area altogether? <br/>I think this must be assessed on a species basis and with sensitivity to harvest mode and season. In a demonstration that members of the Maine DMR Ascophyllum Fisheries Management Plan members saw with a mechanical harvester in 2013 (2014?), large packs of Ascophyllum were cut and bundled by a mechanical harvester on the Maine coast. In taking apart one of these large bales, bycatch was 2 small periwinkle snails (insignificant bycatch in that demo).<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Susan H.

I am astonished this even exists. Companies that are based in the US should hire US Citizens first (see disheartening email list of applications for STEM roles 2020-2023 attached). If they want to participate in the US economy and do business here, they should include members of that economy first and especially right now during these tough times when it comes to STEM jobs. I would even go one further, in that they should be barred from outsourcing or bringing in foreigners in at least for the next few years. The US is in need of a recovery, most of us have been suffering for a long time now, don&#39;t make us suffer any more.  We want to work, we have families, we have University studies and debts we&#39;ve taken in order to attain the skills for these jobs. <br/>My attached file is only partial in the quantity of STEM roles I have applied for since the breakout of COVID up until the turn of this year. Take a look. I am at my wits end and currently working basically for free (unpaid for now) in an unsigned role - just to gain more experience or if this one ends up yielding any kind of a future.<br/><br/>I&#39;m 30-40 yrs old, worked my butt off in my 20s to pay off community college and then took loans for University - all on my own. I would like to have kids but cant because of the current and recent situation with jobs in the space. I would like to participate in the economy building software that I know I&#39;m well qualified for, I&#39;ve earned the chance at a minimum, do not take what little chance I could have.",

            "comment": "Unions have serious concerns with both the premise and the impact of Schedule A designations. Nationwide labor shortages are a misleading and artificial construct, and unions assert that they cannot and should not be determined in a blanket fashion.  Moreover, when the response to perceived shortages is to permit employers to hire from abroad without even looking for workers domestically, those labor market distortions risk turning temporary shortages into structural shortages.<br/><br/>The attached comments begin by explaining how predetermined labor shortage designations harm workers, using the impact of Schedule A on the nursing workforce as illustration. To prevent adverse effects on wages and working conditions, we urge DOL to restrict Schedule A to only those positions that require exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or performing arts (currently Group II).  Should the Department decide to proceed with broader Schedule A designations, robust, transparent occupational assessments must be undertaken at regular intervals. We outline indicators that should be considered in determining which occupations to include, and urge particular caution to prevent interference in labor standard setting for emerging industries.  <br/><br/>Prolonged Schedule A designation for nursing has failed to improve systemic staffing challenges in the healthcare industry, we therefore recommend that RNs be removed from Schedule A. We further believe that the designation of any STEM or STW occupations on Schedule A is inappropriate and unjustifiable based on currently-available economic data. Simply put, there is no broad-based shortage of STEM workers that could justify Schedule A designation. Many qualified U.S. graduates with STEM degrees are working outside the field or unable to find STEM-related employment. Wages in STEM occupations have not increased in real terms, working conditions are frequently harsh, and employer attitudes towards worker organizing hostile: all phenomena that are inconsistent with the purported shortage asserted by employers. The volatility in this occupational sector and its tendency to go through boom-and-bust cycles that involve extensive layoffs further underscores the need for context-specific labor market testing, rather than a broad exemption from such testing. <br/><br/>Finally, we present preferred alternatives to Schedule A, and call for substantially elevated protections for workers in any occupation with a Schedule A designation.<br/>",

            "comment": "Future Union is grateful for the opportunity to submit comments to the U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s proposed rule on outbound investment. This rule follows Executive Order 14105, which declared a national emergency on the investment in national security products that benefited our adversaries. For too long we have had an open door policy to investing in countries of concern and helping them develop the tools that undermine our national security. This proposed rule must protect our national security to the fullest extent possible.<br/><br/>The era of globalization and the admission of China to the World Trade Organization (WTO) saw the global economy become more interconnected with capital flows between countries skyrocketing. An international environment focused on deepening trade ties with lower tariffs and a global investment environment saw fund managers and capital market actors in the United States chase gains in countries of concern. At the time, China was seen as the adversarial threat it is recognized as today by only a handful of forward-thinking national security officials. Today that recognition is near universal but the actions we take today should have been taken years ago. We are playing catch-up to a country that has been planning our downfall for years. <br/><br/>One of the most compelling reasons to stop outbound investment to China is to protect vital national security interests including the development of cutting edge technologies. Investments in key sectors such as technology, healthcare, defense, and energy all have material impacts on our national security if our adversaries gain a headstart. Financing your enemy is akin to cutting off your nose to spite your face. The difference being, some are actively profiting on undermining America&rsquo;s security. The government can and should act to stop this.<br/><br/>The Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s ever present involvement in the activities of so-called private entities in China means that there is no separation between business and state. They are two heads of the same beast and we cannot continue to pretend otherwise. Companies that willingly finance Chinese investments in technology, biotech, energy, and agri-tech are actively supporting the Chinese Communist Party. These investments will not be limited to the civilian sphere, they will be used by the Chinese defense sector to undermine American interests and global security. Further financing is detrimental international stability - outbound investment to China must cease.<br/><br/>China has proven to be a hostile actor not just in its actions in the South China Sea where it routinely violates international law and seeks to bully its neighbors risking armed conflict. Not even in its constant violation of international trade law, distorting markets and harming industries and employment in countries around the globe. It has a consistent record of violating every norm of behavior and every statute of international law in its wanton belief that it is entitled to hegemony. The theft of technology and intellectual property from the Western world is the most publicized example of China&rsquo;s brazen disregard for international law. State-sponsored theft, state-sponsored hacking, and corporate espionage under the direction and with the support of the CCP are all part of Chinese statecraft. There can be no illusions that China wishes to peacefully rise and be a part of the global system when it has spent the last few decades stealing its way to the top. American investors must fully divest from China and stop financing their own demise by giving money to the people stealing their IP and technology.<br/><br/>As we evolve our response to the China challenge, there are several areas where we can strengthen offensive and defensive capabilities. The proposed rule offers an opportunity to plug the leaks in our capital markets infrastructure. For too long, investors have gotten away with rewarding their LPs with profits at the cost of American security. That must end and the proposed rule must ensure that there are no carve outs or alternative avenues for hedge funds, endowments, private equity groups, and pension funds that are seeking to finance our enemies and undermine global security and international stability. <br/>",

As scientists and technical specialists, we feel the report is a step forward in understanding the risks of unconventional oil and gas development and that it can begin to offer communities throughout the country the reliable scientific data they seek to make more informed decisions. However, we believe the study can be improved to meet its charge of assessing potential water quality impacts of hydraulic fracturing.<br/><br/>Overall, the report&#39;s topline messages in the executive summary and press materials appear not to be congruent with its findings. We ask that the final report be clearer in all communications about the documented cases of water quality impacts found. While it is true that impacts were not found to be widespread across all wells, the report, executive summary, and press materials should clearly and explicitly state the water quality impacts demonstrated by the study&#39;s findings in order for citizens and scientists to understand the potential risks associated with hydraulic fracturing. <br/><br/>As technical researchers, we empathize with the data collection limitations that the EPA faced in this research. However, we also encourage more clarity in communicating these research challenges and their impact on the report&#39;s findings. For example:<br/>- The study focused narrowly on one part of unconventional oil and gas development, despite evidence of water quality impacts from other steps of the process.<br/>- The study was limited by a lack of baseline testing of water quality conditions prior to the onset of development.<br/>- As the study lightly acknowledges, the work was limited by a lack of access to industry data.<br/><br/>While a substantive amount of research did go into this report, these significant limitations need to be more clearly understandable to the reader. The final report and associated products should acknowledge study limitations up front, emphasize the need for additional study in this area, and contain language that is more measured and consistent with the findings.<br/><br/>Further, we ask that the EPA continue its investigation into water quality impacts of hydraulic fracturing with this study. Clearly, additional assessment is necessary to fully understand the risks to water quality presented by hydraulic fracturing. Most prominently, the agency should develop prospective studies that include comprehensive baseline monitoring. The agency should also use its authority under the Safe Drinking Water Act to investigate alleged cases of water contamination despite anticipated pressures from states and companies against doing so. <br/><br/>Communities deserve access to the best available science on the risks associated with unconventional oil and gas development, and the EPA should play a stronger role in providing that information.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>The undersigned<br/>(475 scientists, researchers, and technical experts)<br/>",

            "comment": "See attached file(s)<br/>Future Union is grateful for the opportunity to submit comments to the U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s proposed rule on outbound investment. This rule follows Executive Order 14105, which declared a national emergency on the investment in national security products that benefited our adversaries. For too long we have had an open door policy to investing in countries of concern and helping them develop the tools that undermine our national security. This proposed rule must protect our national security to the fullest extent possible.<br/><br/>The era of globalization and the admission of China to the World Trade Organization (WTO) saw the global economy become more interconnected with capital flows between countries skyrocketing. An international environment focused on deepening trade ties with lower tariffs and a global investment environment saw fund managers and capital market actors in the United States chase gains in countries of concern. At the time, China was seen as the adversarial threat it is recognized as today by only a handful of forward-thinking national security officials. Today that recognition is near universal but the actions we take today should have been taken years ago. We are playing catch-up to a country that has been planning our downfall for years. <br/><br/>One of the most compelling reasons to stop outbound investment to China is to protect vital national security interests including the development of cutting edge technologies. Investments in key sectors such as technology, healthcare, defense, and energy all have material impacts on our national security if our adversaries gain a headstart. Financing your enemy is akin to cutting off your nose to spite your face. The difference being, some are actively profiting on undermining America&rsquo;s security. The government can and should act to stop this.<br/><br/>The Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s ever present involvement in the activities of so-called private entities in China means that there is no separation between business and state. They are two heads of the same beast and we cannot continue to pretend otherwise. Companies that willingly finance Chinese investments in technology, biotech, energy, and agri-tech are actively supporting the Chinese Communist Party. These investments will not be limited to the civilian sphere, they will be used by the Chinese defense sector to undermine American interests and global security. Further financing is detrimental international stability - outbound investment to China must cease.<br/><br/>China has proven to be a hostile actor not just in its actions in the South China Sea where it routinely violates international law and seeks to bully its neighbors risking armed conflict. Not even in its constant violation of international trade law, distorting markets and harming industries and employment in countries around the globe. It has a consistent record of violating every norm of behavior and every statute of international law in its wanton belief that it is entitled to hegemony. The theft of technology and intellectual property from the Western world is the most publicized example of China&rsquo;s brazen disregard for international law. State-sponsored theft, state-sponsored hacking, and corporate espionage under the direction and with the support of the CCP are all part of Chinese statecraft. There can be no illusions that China wishes to peacefully rise and be a part of the global system when it has spent the last few decades stealing its way to the top. American investors must fully divest from China and stop financing their own demise by giving money to the people stealing their IP and technology.<br/><br/>As we evolve our response to the China challenge, there are several areas where we can strengthen offensive and defensive capabilities. The proposed rule offers an opportunity to plug the leaks in our capital markets infrastructure. For too long, investors have gotten away with rewarding their LPs with profits at the cost of American security. That must end and the proposed rule must ensure that there are no carve outs or alternative avenues for hedge funds, endowments, private equity groups, and pension funds that are seeking to finance our enemies and undermine global security and international stability. <br/>",

            "comment": "I am a physics researcher at UC Berkeley. I am concerned that this rule would severely impact American dominance in science and technology. American educational institutions attract some of the most brilliant people in the world, and it is to our advantage to retain them. According to a 2012 ITIC report, each foreign-born graduate of a U.S. program entering STEM work create[s] on average 2.62 jobs for American workers, from their impact on US innovation and R&amp;D. However, many US physics institutions are suffering potentially destabilizing declines in applications. In some cases, this has forced them to lower their standards for admissions. According to a survey performed by the American Physical Society (APS), these declines are a result of both the perception of the US as unwelcoming to foreigners and the fact that nearly 30% of students trying to come to the US report having challenges obtaining a student visa.<br/><br/>I work in the field of quantum computing, and I can assure you that US dominance in this field is due in no small part to the US&#39;s ability to attract brilliant people from all over the world to do research in this field. International students make it to the US through an incredibly competitive system, often winning international competitions to earn their place at our top universities. To discourage them from coming would directly harm our research, and cede this essential edge to our competitors. Just as harmful to US interests would be to force them to leave the US right after we educate them.<br/><br/>H1B applicants already need to show that their wage is competitive. This proposed rule raises the bar to the extent that it is actually higher than salaries at many big tech companies (e.g. Amazon, Google). This change is thus part of a significant effort to discourage talented international students from staying and working in the US, which devastating to the economy and to our research enterprises.",

            "comment": "The most important step for the US government will be to implement this to enable OFAC oversight and control over digital assets by tracing the origin of all mined Bitcoin using a PoS ledger which tracks and traces origin, miner, electricity used and the IMEI of the mining device for every Bitcoin as an NFT.<br/><br/>Please see the Twitter account for details of how (the OHFUK Protocol) https://twitter.com/ohfukprotocol/status/1570575960596172801?s=46&amp;t=RdWuaOouphk2yrKmiEgxeg<br/><br/>People like Vladimir Putin can mine unlimited BTC and that needs to stop ASAP. Ultimately there needs to be a dual market of trusted and non trusted coins. This is core to keeping the world order as is. <br/><br/>The next important step will be to regulate stablecoins. I have written a letter to Mr Gensler in this regard and the way the government reacted reflects the point I made in my letter prior to the announcements. I can deliver those on request.<br/><br/>Another important thing is to create a way for anyone to create a fork or a copy of any Blockchain or Hashgraph network to create the new internet Web5G and enable micro grids of networks to run interoperably to create effective structures and communications of all L1s and the assets that live on them.<br/><br/>There should be clear collaboration P3 framework for access to background checks and also for the development of post quantum encryption &amp; distributed grid computing of idle resources. The Cloud Edge powered by Web5G.<br/><br/>Hedera Hashgraph should be given special attention due to its superiority versus Blockchain<br/><br/>There should be a new form of &ldquo;Digital Security Platform&rdquo; which should mint and award token offerings an NFT on the future CBDC network Hedera Hashgraph which certifies the SECs security offering clearance. The TOKO platform built by DLA Piper could play a big role.<br/><br/>Standards of interoperability of networks should become mandatory requirements for networks depending on market cap due to the FREE MARKETS ACT<br/><br/>There should be a special task force to help with international crypto criminals and we should be able to easily reach them 24/7 globally to detect and solve crime of all kind<br/><br/>There should be an oversight on tokens being used for political campaign financing and swaying of voters. A candidate could theoretically offer tokens as rewards for loyalty or donation and this needs regulation!!! <br/><br/>There needs to be more clarity on the crafting of digital commodities and how Mr Gensler defines this because of Bitcoin is a Digital Commodity, then an email is also. <br/><br/>There is also need for a better guidance of how one can get listed on exchanges with equal power for the market participants<br/><br/>There should be guidance on how one can commercialise emerging technologies better <br/><br/>There should be more P3 partnerships for web3 to make it a safe place we want our kids to be in<br/><br/>Big tech companies should be required to natively install safe government approved wallets on user phones to enable the free markets act and also economic accessibility for the unbanked according to the UN SDG goals<br/><br/>The US Government should create a framework for understanding emerging technologies as a sensible environment but not curb innovation by over regulatory tech. There needs to be a forum of industry professionals coming together with sociologist and law makers to shape the internet into a better form that it is in today.m. Clear regulatory guidance can help save the values of the free world for which we all stand. America means freedom and Crypto can help people around the globe escape poverty and economic inaccessibility whilst it is a great opportunity for governments to enroll Universal Basic Income using expiring USD bank note CBDCs on the Hedera Network <br/><br/>We will see everything on distributed ledgers and those that are most scalable, ABFT and quantum resistant should lead the way of taking America forward. The Hashgraph algorithm is the most valuable piece of code in cyberspace. <br/><br/>We need to also create easy communication channels between innovators and crypto network by means of standardised frameworks of launching assets on these networks. These need to be standardised in order to deliver mass adoption and not in order to curb any innovation. <br/><br/>Reach out s@homr.app",

            "comment": "Every automobile should be doused with the Ebola virus!  Offended by this? Then please wake up and get out of the pocket of automobile manufacturers. V2V is nothing more than a deadly industry sponsored effort to increase the spread of what the World Health Organization [WHO] classified  a possible carcinogen, radiofrequency [RF] radiation. Cancer risk aside, RF exposure is causing acute medical problems [i.e. heart arythmia, headaches, spontaneous bleeding, rash, exhaustion, etc.] to tens if not hundreds of thousands who may or may not know the cause of their symptoms. <br/><br/>NHTSA asks for scientific information. For Pete&#39;s sake spend an hour on the internet looking up terms like smart meter problems, microwave sickness, RF effects. Well documented research on the biological effects of low level [considered non-thermal] RF going back at least 50 years and includes extensive work by DOD, DIA and various branches of the military who saw both health issues from radar exposure and opportunities as non-destructive weaponry. In a world of ever-increasing &quot;electro-smog&quot; we have a coming nightmare the likes of which tobacco and asbestos never saw. Bad enough we have involuntary exposure [esteemed researchers Hallberg &amp; Oberfeld extrapolating from past years of electromagnetic hypersensitivity predict 50% of our population will be sensitive by 2017], to mandate it is nothing less than a crime against humanity and no, I don&#39;t in the least consider this hyperbole.<br/><br/>To quote from a colleague in CA: <br/><br/>&quot;I have a Masters Degree in Transportation Planning from the University of the West of England in Bristol, UK, and more than four years experience working to document and reverse the community and individual health damage occurring from wireless technology.<br/><br/>I also have personal experience with electro-sensitivity.  In certain situations when exposed to wireless radiation from wireless devices or cell towers, I have experienced headaches, sudden nausea, heart palpitations and other symptoms.  <br/><br/>Requiring a device- on every car in the United States- which emits microwave frequencies that can cause these kinds of symptoms in drivers- can in no way be described as a &quot;safety project.&quot;  <br/><br/>Such a project needs to be put on hold indefinitely, in light of emerging evidence of the carcinogenicity and neurological impairment that can be caused by exposure to wireless radiation, particularly from multiple sources at once, such as with a future scenario from the car&#39;s wi-fi, personal cell phone, nearby cell tower, V2V transmitter, nearby smart meters, etc.  <br/><br/>The effect of such radiation is cumulative.  <br/>Those drivers needing to limit the radiation in their cars- for medical reasons- should be able to do so.  <br/>Public transit should have &quot;quiet areas&quot; with no wireless use allowed.<br/><br/>Mandating a toxic &quot;possibly carcinogenic&quot; (according to the World Health Organization) radiation emitter in everyone&#39;s car is a violation of the ADA and will be inviting mass non-participation and project failure if it is allowed to proceed without an investigation into the driver safety impacts of exposure to high frequency pulsed microwave radiation.<br/><br/>And speaking personally,<br/><br/>You will have to pry my cold, dead fingers from the steering wheel before I will ever let you install one of these in my car.&quot;<br/><br/>We strongly second the quoted comments above and request the V2V proposal be rejected like a gift of Ebola. At the following links some valuable information on health effects of RF can be found. These links don&#39;t begin to scratch the surface.<br/><br/>Intervenor filed evidence by category<br/>http://www.mainecoalitiontostopsmartmeters.org/2013/04/intervenor-evidence/ <br/><br/>Expert and lay witness testimony in Maine Smart Meter health &amp; safety investigation<br/>http://www.mainecoalitiontostopsmartmeters.org/2013/02/introduction-to-our-puc-filings-of-expert-and-lay-witness-testimony/<br/><br/>One of the most recent comprehensive compendiums on biological effects of RF- Bioinitiatives Report [2012]<br/>http://www.bioinitiative.org/ <br/><br/>One of the witnesses in our investigation had this to say and it applies to the illegitimate proliferation of RF emitting devise in general:<br/><br/>Smart meters threaten our health, our privacy, our security and in no small way our human rights, democracy, dignity and way of life. Smart meters are one of the largest uncontrolled toxic biological experiments of our time. An experiment sanctioned by Maine legislators on unsuspecting and trusting citizens, citizens who are getting ill just going home, making dinner, going to bed; living. Their deployment is unconscionable. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment. <br/><br/>Ed Friedman, Spokesperson<br/>Maine Coalition to Stop Smart Meters<br/><br/>",

            "comment": "To the USDA and the Committee for Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA),<br/><br/>My name is Dr. Richard M Fleming. I am a Physicist-Physician and I am the author of the &quot;Inflammation and Heart Disease&quot; and &quot;Angina&quot; Theories (Inflammation and Heart Disease; Fleming Unified Theory of Vascular Disease. 1-655833842. Started 9-1-2011. Effective 9-16-2011, TX 7-451-244.). These are the Theories which so many people use to talk about Heart Disease, Cancer and Inflammation.<br/><br/>I have previously provided written testimony at the request of the USDA (01-11-2001), have been a grant reviewer for USDHHS (2006-2016) and served as a Moderator for the Obama-Biden Transition team (12-29-2008).<br/><br/>Most recently, the Editors of The Annals of Internal Medicine included my comments on-line for readers to consider as they reviewed the recent publications on Red Meat and Processed foods and any associated risks for Heart Disease and Cancer.<br/><br/>A decision to alter the current recommendations is NOT well founded. As you will see from my CV (attached), in 2008 I published a paper (attached) showing that measured changes in blood tests (inter alia cholesterol, CRP, fibrinogen) do not correlate with changes in coronary artery disease (CAD) - thus using these blood tests to determine success is not helpful. While it is true these blood tests measure components of the &quot;Inflammation and Heart Disease&quot;, they are measure what is present in the blood and not what is present in the tissue (ie. the coronary arteries or tissue where cancer is a concern). <br/><br/>As a further explanation I include the copy of the FMTVDM Study Protocol - in two parts due to the size limitations for submission here - which will allow us to better understand what impact each of the diets actually have. Only by measuring the effect of these diets can an objective series of recommendations be made. <br/><br/>I may be reached for further comments or to answer any questions you might have. I would be available by skype for further discussions or to appear for the committee.<br/><br/>Most respectfully,<br/><br/>Richard M Fleming, PhD, MD, JD",

            "comment": "FMTVDM provides the first and only truly quantitative method which can accurately, consistently and reproducibly measure tissue changes allowing differentiation of tissue based upon regional blood flow and metabolism, using any type of nuclear imaging tool. FMTVDM is the only tool which is actually calibrated and the calibration is part of the actual patent itself. As such FMTVDM including the calibration component (TFM) and the cancer component (B.E.S.T. Imaging) allows earlier detection of disease and transitioning states of tissue leading up to the &quot;diseased&quot; state. It is NOT experimental and it is not plagued with the sensitivity and specificity issues associated with qualitative tests. Because FMTVDM-B.E.S.T. can make these measurements, it can also tell you if your treatment is working-or not. This means women and men, receiving the best possible treatment; saving time, money and most importantly - LIVES.<br/><br/>If the FDA is interested in using FMTVDM, we will work with the FDA and HHS to allow for the accurate measurement of which treatments do and do not work, allowing a more rapid investigation of drug and other treatments for both heart disease and cancers. Since it provides &quot;quantitative&quot; measurements, the sample sized and time required to determine treatment effects will be smaller and faster, assisting with the rapid throughput of investigations for drug treatment trials.
